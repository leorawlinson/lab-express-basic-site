        Honnold takes part in many different climbing disciplines including
        bouldering, trad-climbing, sport climbing and soloing. However he has
        gained notoriety in the climbing community and the outisde world for his
        many free solo climbs on big walls. Free soloing is the act of climbing
        without any saftey equipment such as ropes or harnesses. It is
        considered to be the most pure form of climbing but is not very popular
        as the possible consquences are dire. To this day Honnold is the only
        climber to make ascents of major climbing routes around the world as a
        free soloist. He puts years of practice in on routes before his free
        solo attempts which allows him to do them in a calm and collected
        manner.
